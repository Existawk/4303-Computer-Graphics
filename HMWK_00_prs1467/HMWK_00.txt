Assignment 00

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:

  * Demonstrate ability to run a simple Python3 program that
      displays SDF files.

  * Demonstrate ability to change two frickin' lines of code in
      that simple Python3 program.

  * Demonstrate ability to take a screenshot properly.  (No,
      really;  for some persons, this is harder than it sounds. :)

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
Background:

  * The Display tool is in the Modules > Tools section on Canvas.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks:

  1. Download hmwk_00_dalioba.zip from Canvas.

  2. Unzip this file somewhere convenient.

  3. Surprise!  The only file in the directory is this HMWK_00.txt
      set of instructions.

  4. Download Display.zip from the Modules > Tools section on
      Canvas.

  5. Unzip this file somewhere convenient.

  6. Look in the Display/ directory and see that there are a
      number of files, including a handy-dandy README.txt.  Read
      that file.

  7. Change the background color of the canvas by editing line 40
      in Dislay/myGraphics.py.  Right now the color is a neutral
      grey, #C0C0C0.  Change this color so that it is NOT a grey,
      white, or black color.  (Remember, the lines are drawn in
      black and they need to be clearly visible against the
      background.)

  8. Change the NetID on line 114 from 'dalioba' to YOUR NetID.
      (Remember that your NetID is three letters followed by four
      or five digits, so it'll be something like 'abc1234'.)

  9. Run the Display tool, display the 'test.sdf' file and take a
      screenshot of the Display tool window showing off your
      spiffy new background color and personalized message.

      The screenshot should be similar to the example in the
      Display tool directory, though it will of course show YOUR
      background color and YOUR NetID.

      The screenshot MUST be in PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
      format.

      Trim the screenshot so that it shows ONLY the Display tool
      window, just as the example screenshot does.  (I am not
      interested in anything else that you keep on your desktop.
      Really. :)

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
Submission:

Name your screenshot 'hmwk_00_abc1234.png', but with YOUR NetID in
the place of 'abc1234' and submit this image file on Canvas as
your results for this assignment.

The image file MUST be in PNG (Portable Network Graphics format)!

Different OSes have a history of mucking with screenshots and file
formats, so ENSURE that your screenshot is actually a PNG file and
not some other format.  If your screenshot is not in standard
Portable Network Graphics format, you get ZERO credit for it, so
be careful!

Hints:
  1. The background color for the canvas is specified using HTML
      color notation in hex format.  The color is represented with
      a # symbol followed by three two-digit hex numbers, for a
      total of six hex digits.

      The first two digits after the # represent the RED component
      of the color.  The second two digits represent the GREEN
      component of the color.  The last two digits represent the
      BLUE component.

      If the three pairs of digits are the same (or even very
      close in value) to each other, the color will be a neutral
      grey of some intensity.  If the numbers are relatively
      small, the grey color will be closer to black (#000000).
      The bigger the numbers get, the closer to white (#FFFFFF)
      the grey color will appear.

      Pure red is #FF0000.  Pure green is #00FF00.  Pure blue is
      #0000FF.

      You want your background color to have a non-grey tint to
      it, so make at least one of the three numbers different
      enough from the other two.

      You want your background color to be on the lighter side so
      the drawn black lines stand out, so make the numbers larger
      rather than smaller (which would be darker).

      For example, #FFC0CB is light pink color.  It has a red
      component of FF, a green component of C0, and blue is CB.

      Notice that the red component is larger enough than the
      green and blue components to give this color a reddish tint.
      All three components are large enough to make the color an
      overall lighter shade so the black lines stand out.

      Experiment a bit to get you own nice shade.  DO NOT USE
      #FFC0CB!  If you use #FFC0CB, you will get ZERO credit.

      Geez, spend a few moments and pick out your OWN color.

  2. After you submit your image file on Canvas, download it from
     Canvas into an empty directory and check that your image
     shows a different, non-grey, white, or black background and
     YOUR NetID.  Ensure that your background color is NOT
     #FFC0CB.  Ensure that that your screenshot really is a
     standard Portable Network Graphics file.  Ensure that your
     screenshot is properly named.

  3. Are you CERTAIN you complied with all of these nit-picking
     instructions?  Really?  Maybe you ought to check just one
     more time. :)
